# QuEST
The official repository for **QuEST: Low-bit Diffusion Model Quantization via Efficient Selective Finetuning** [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03666)

QuEST achieves state-of-the-art performance on mutiple high-resolution image generation tasks, including unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation and text-to-image generation. We also achieve superior performance on full 4-bit (W4A4) generation.
